# ZAP-Focus
Built a terminal-based output - productivity timer to help Individuals with ADHD better overcome their distractive nature and improve focus.

MY FIRST MINI PYTHON PROJECT 
:)
.

ZAP-Focus is a terminal-based Pomodoro productivity assistant designed to help users with ADHD (like me) or anyone struggling with procrastination stay focused and organized.

The app combines a simple task manager with the proven Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. | Editable through minor chaanges in the code.

Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and run a live countdown timer directly in the terminal. During each phase (focus or break), the program prints motivational quotes tailored for focus and positive reinforcement — something I personally value while working through attention challenges.

The biggest challenge was figuring out how to display a live countdown in the Stanford Code In Place IDE console, which doesn’t support live updates on the same line.

I worked around this by printing each second of the countdown on a new line using time.sleep() and sys.stdout.flush(), which gave a decent live-feel even within IDE limitations.

This project reflects my own need for structured yet flexible focus tools, and I’m really proud of how it turned out. It’s simple but functional and most importantly, it’s mine. Building it helped me apply loops, conditionals, functions, dictionaries, and more in a meaningful way.
